<div class="paragraph">
Hi Daniel. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. I’ll keep it short and simple, and I’m really excited to learn from your journey. Shall we start?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Yes, sure thing.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
I would like to start with your journey. How did you first get into AI?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Probably around 2015, I started listening to a lot of technology podcasts. I’ve always been into computers from a young age. Around that time, machine learning was becoming more popular, especially deep learning.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
I tried web development, but I didn’t enjoy writing every possible use case manually. When I discovered machine learning, I realized you show a model the inputs and outputs, and it learns the connection. That suited how my brain works.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
At that time, I was working at Apple as a technical specialist. Later, I quit and worked on a startup with friends called Any Gym. It didn’t succeed, but I learned a lot.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
After that, I studied machine learning full-time for about nine months in my parents’ garage. I was living off savings and driving Uber on weekends. I posted my learning progress online, and eventually someone reached out with an opportunity. Since 2017, I’ve been working in machine learning in some form almost every day.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Did you study AI in college, or did you learn it on your own?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
I went to university, but I studied food science and nutrition. Before that, I started in biomedical science because I wanted to become a doctor. I changed paths after about a year.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
University taught me how to learn, how to read scientific papers, and how to write them. That helped later when reading machine learning research. However, all my programming and AI knowledge came from online resources. I don’t consider myself self-taught in isolation because many great teachers created those resources.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
How long did it take you to feel comfortable with the basics of AI?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
I’m still working on the basics. Concepts like gradient descent and backpropagation are still fundamental today. Every large language model is ultimately trained using similar foundational steps.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
I’ve felt like an imposter many times, even now. But I’ve reframed that feeling as motivation to improve. In technology, your skills must evolve constantly. The real skill is learning how to apply solutions to problems, not just memorizing tools.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When you were starting out, did you focus more on theory or practical projects?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
I consider myself more practical. I enjoy building and deploying real applications. However, theory gives ideas for practical experiments. I spend time building projects, but I also read research papers and think about improvements.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
For me, the best learning happens when I try something, run into errors, and solve them. Turning an idea into something real is the most valuable part.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
What’s a common mistake you see beginners make?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
They don’t have enough fun. Learning should be enjoyable, even if it’s challenging. Many beginners get overwhelmed by the amount of information available.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
It’s better to commit to one focused project for a few months instead of trying everything at once. Errors are valuable because they teach you what doesn’t work.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Did you ever feel like giving up when you were learning AI?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Many times. I tried learning to code three or four times before sticking with it. Even during the nine months of full-time study, I questioned whether it would work out.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
Now, when I feel like giving up, I take a break and reconsider. Continuing gives you a chance to improve. Giving up guarantees no progress.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
What excites you most about AI right now?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
AI is far more accessible today. Tools like Hugging Face, Google Colab, and AI assistants make experimentation easier than when I started.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
You can now download new models and test them quickly. AI chat tools can act as tutors, helping you learn step by step.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
What advice would you give someone my age who wants to start learning AI seriously?
</div>

<div class="speaker daniel">Daniel:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Just get started. There is no perfect roadmap. Focus on building skills over time. Work on projects that interest you, stay consistent, and understand that expertise comes from repeated effort over a long period.
</div>

<div class="speaker farhan">Farhan:</div>
<div class="paragraph">
okay yeah that's all Thank you again for your time and guidance, I truly appreciate it.
